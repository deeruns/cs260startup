# cs260startup
startup project for cs260

## Elevator Pitch and Key Features:
In honor of the **OLYMPIC GAMES** this last summer, and all the **BYU** runners that qualified for the Olympics, I want to make a website to show our love and support for our olympians. This website will have images of each of the BYU athletes at the olympic games and every time you click on their picture the counter goes up for that individual person. There will be a local and a total count value available on different menu screens. I am a member of the BYU Track and Field and Cross Country team, so once I am finished I will show them the product and all the support they have recieved.

## Technologies
### HTML: Used for each page, one for login, one for voting, one for total scores
### CSS: used to style the page with BYU colors and theme
### JavaScript: will provide the login for my page and will apply all votes to each BYU runner individually
### React: react to the click of the user on each runners image
### DB: will store each users individual votes for the runner and the total global count
### WebSocket: update the votes to other users on the global tally
