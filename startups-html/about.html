                This website is a place to show your support and love for BYU runners and olympians. Running is a sport that doesn't get much love and attention due to the little media coverage. We appreciate any support we can get, running is a sport that everyone and anyone can love and participate in.
             </p>

                At the 2024 Paris Olympic Games BYU had 6 athletes from the Track and Field distance program participate. We had Kenneth Rooks and James Corrigan run in the 3000m Steeplechase. We had Clayton Young and Conner Mantz compete in the Marathon. On the Womens side we had Whittni Orton-Morgan in the 5000m and Courtney Wayment in the 3000m Steeplechase.

                BYU send the most athletes to the Olympic Games for Track and Field than any other NCAA program.
